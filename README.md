**Intro**

This site is a social media platform for displaying images. Visitors to a profile page can like images using the heart icon.

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on a varity of popular screen sizes. This project was created from a Figma design brief. Images and fonts were gathered from design brief.

This project was created iteratively. Initially, I developed the HTML and CSS working off of a design brief. Later, I used Webpack and API to improve the functionality of the project.

**Figma**

This project was created using a Figma design brief. All fonts, sizing, and styles were integrated into the code using HTML & CSS.

**Images**

Images were imported directly from Figma. All images and icons were optimized with [tinify](https://tinypng.com/).

This project was created for Sprint 3 through 10 in the Triple Ten Bootcamp. Images can be added to the Spots user page by pasting a URL into the new post modal and adding a description. The images are stored on a server and retrieved using APIs.

Plans for improving project: This project will be updated with additional information and Javascript code in the coming Sprints in Triple Ten Bootcamp.
