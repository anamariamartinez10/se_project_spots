**Intro**

This site is a social media platform for displaying images. Visitors to a profile page can like images using the heart icon.

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on a varity of popular screen sizes. This project was created from a Figma design brief. Images and fonts were gathered from design brief.

This project was created iteratively. Initially, I developed the HTML and CSS working off of a design brief. Later, I used Webpack and API to improve the functionality of the project.

**Figma**

This project was created using a Figma design brief. All fonts, sizing, and styles were integrated into the code using HTML & CSS.

**Images**

Images were imported directly from Figma. All images and icons were optimized with [tinify](https://tinypng.com/).

This project was created for Sprint 3 in the Triple Ten Bootcamp.
A deployed version of the project can be found here: [SPOTS home page](https://anamariamartinez10.github.io/se_project_spots/)

Plans for improving project: This project will be updated with additional information and Javascript code in the coming Sprints in Triple Ten Bootcamp.
